# Find-audio-topic-using-deeplearning

- Developed a pipeline to handle large audio files, splitting them into manageable chunks for processing.
- 
- Utilized OpenAI Whisper and Facebook wav2vec2 for speech-to-text to each chunk.
- 
- Conducted semantic analysis of each text chunk against a broad spectrum of dynamic queries.
